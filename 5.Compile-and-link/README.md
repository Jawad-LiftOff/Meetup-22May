Instructions to Run
-------------------

You should be able run some of the example by simply opening the file in browser using file:// protocol.. but service examples will fail, set the files up on any web server. We've put in a simple http-server app that servers the file.

* Install node http-server(or any server of your choice) -- `npm install http-server`
* run the command 'http-server' in the application folder(or run whatever server you are using)
* Open your favorite browser & access the sample app @ http://localhost:8080/(or whatever port the app is hosted over)
